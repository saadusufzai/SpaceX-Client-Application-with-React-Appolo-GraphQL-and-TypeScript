# SpaceX Clien App with react-typescript and graphql
  Using this app you can find out the real time spaceX Information . 
  Information about their launches, company, ships and much more
  The data is coming from SpaceX offical API and is a property of SpaceX 
  I am just using this data for educational purposes (to build this app and try Apollo Graphql )
  
## Dependencies
install our additional dependencies. Our app will use Apollo to execute GraphQL API requests. The libraries needed for Apollo are apollo-boost, react-apollo, react-apollo-hooks,  graphql-tag, and graphql.
    yarn add apollo-boost react-apollo react-apollo-hooks graphql-tag graphql

## Types generation
Used graphql-codegen to auto generate types for the gql queries

## React Router V6
